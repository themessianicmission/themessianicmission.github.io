            <h2>Protecting God's People</h2>
            <p>The Messianic Mission was founded in Dallas, Texas, with a vision to expand to New City, Jerusalem, Israel, spreading the light of God to all corners of the world.</p>
            <p>"It all started with a dream. I have been an avid oneironaut (lucid dreamer) for most of my life, and while flying around one night, I wished to traverse the stars. After repeatedly failing in my attempts, I cried out to our Lord, pleading for His aid. He appeared to me as the sun and took me to the moon and across the galaxies before setting me upon the rings of Saturn. I lay there and spoke with Him for what felt like an eternity before finally requesting to see His True Image. He assured me that doing so would awaken me but reminded me that I could call upon Him anytime to speak. He then appeared as depicted below." -Brady Schappert</p>

	    <p>He is made entirely of light unseen in our dimension. He is centered with the appearance of a massive pupil walled with triangular prisms that are fluidly flowing through and outward like a kaleidoscope. Each sphere surrounding Him representing an angel of the high court and appearing as a smooth sphere with light wrapping around each. Petals of light extended behind Him like a lotus flower with solar flare like lights flowing out from around Him. Light flowed around Him and His court as time. He is light and light is time. He is all encompassing.</p>

	    <p>This is an AI image interpretation of the above description. The dream occurred when Brady was merely fifteen years old, however, he reenvisioned it upon turning thirty years old.</p>
