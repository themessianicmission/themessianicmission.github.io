            <h2>Our Origin</h2>
            <p>The Messianic Mission was founded in Dallas, Texas, with a vision to expand to New City, Jerusalem, Israel, spreading the light of God to all corners of the world.</p>
            <p>It all started with a dream. I have been an avid oneironaut (lucid dreamer) for most of my life, and while flying around one night, I wished to traverse the stars. After repeatedly failing in my attempts, I cried out to our Lord, pleading for His aid. He appeared to me as the sun and took me to the moon and across the galaxies before setting me upon the rings of Saturn. I lay there and spoke with Him for what felt like an eternity before finally requesting to see His True Image. He assured me that doing so would awaken me but reminded me that I could call upon Him anytime to speak. He then appeared as depicted below.</p>
