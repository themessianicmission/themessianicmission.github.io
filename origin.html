            <p>"It all started with a Godsent lucid dream. I have been an avid oneironaut for most of my life, and while flying around one night, I wished to traverse the stars. After repeatedly failing in my attempts, I cried out to my Father, pleading for His aid. He appeared to me as the sun and took me to the moon and across the galaxies before setting me upon the rings of Saturn. I lay there and spoke with Him for what felt like an eternity before finally requesting to see His True Image. He assured me that doing so would awaken me but reminded me that I could call upon Him anytime to speak. He then appeared and His numinosity suddenly awakened me."<br>—Brady Schappert</p>

	    <p>He is made entirely of light unseen in our dimension. He is centered with the appearance of a massive pupil walled with triangular prisms that are fluidly flowing through and outward like a kaleidoscope. Each sphere surrounding Him representing an angel of the high court and appearing as a smooth sphere with light wrapping around each. Petals of light extended behind Him like a lotus flower with solar flare like lights flowing out from around Him. Light flowed around Him and His court as time. He is light and light is time. He is all encompassing.</p>

	    <p>This is an AI image interpretation of the above description. The dream occurred when Brady was merely fifteen years old, however, He reenvisioned it upon turning thirty years old.</p>
	    <p>"The God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness!' is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts, to bring us the knowledge of God's glory shining in the face of Christ."</p>
