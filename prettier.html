    <h2>Have You Heard</h2>
    <p>
      This is the heartbeat of The Messianic Mission—where Heaven touches Earth
      and testimonies unfold. Here we share the work God is doing through our
      mission: from street ministry and free Bible stands to divine
      appointments, answered prayers, and the preparation of hearts for Christ’s
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s a quiet act of service or a public breakthrough, every update
      reveals how God is moving across the land through obedience, faith, and
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay connected, stay encouraged. The mission is alive—and this is the
      beginning of the end.

      Our mission goes beyond words—we live it out across the streets of South
      Dallas. We prepare sack lunches and distribute essential
      supplies—including Bibles and water—directly to the homeless community,
      meeting both physical and spiritual needs with compassion and care. We
      even read the Word aloud to those without the sight to do so themselves
      and answer any questions they may have about Scripture. Every interaction
      is an opportunity to share the living Word of God, offering hope, healing,
      and the promise of eternal life. These efforts reflect Christ’s love in
      action, made possible by your continued support. Together, we’re reaching
      the lost, uplifting the broken, and protecting God’s people one soul at a
      time.

      On weekend nights in Deep Ellum, we take to the streets with a heart full
      of purpose, handing out free Bibles and water while sharing the Good News
      of Christ. As people pass by, we offer more than just physical
      refreshment—we offer the living Word of God that brings eternal life. Each
      interaction is a divine opportunity to spread His love and light to those
      who may be searching or lost. Your donations make it possible for us to
      continue reaching out in this vibrant community, offering hope and
      salvation to all who will listen.

      "'You are like light for the whole world. A city built on a hill cannot be
      hid. No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead it is put on
      the lampstand, where it gives light for everyone in the house. In the same
      way your light must shine before people, so that they will see the good
      things you do and praise your Father in heaven."

      Your generous donations help us gather essential supplies for our free
      Bible stands—water, Bibles, food, and other outreach materials—so we can
      go out into the streets and boldly share the message of salvation. Every
      Bible given and every conversation sparked is a seed planted for the
      Kingdom. Your support equips us to be living witnesses of the Gospel,
      reaching hearts that may never step inside a church. Thank you for
      standing with The Messianic Mission as we fulfill the Great Commission.

      We arrived in Istanbul just in time for the Universal Peace Federation
      meeting, where we shared our plans for the Middle East. The event was
      uplifting, featuring inspiring speeches and offering wonderful
      opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals. Istanbul itself was
      a vibrant city, where we saw Christians dispersed throughout, alongside
      pockets of various faiths, creating a rich tapestry of diverse beliefs. We
      are looking forward to attending the UPF Summit in Berlin this May.

      believe that you sent me."
