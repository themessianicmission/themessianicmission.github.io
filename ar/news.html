          <h2>Have You Heard</h2>
          <p>
            This is the heartbeat of The Messianic Mission—where Heaven touches Earth
            and testimonies unfold. Here we share the work God is doing through our
            mission: from street ministry and free Bible stands to divine
            appointments, answered prayers, and the preparation of hearts for Christ’s
            return.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it’s a quiet act of service or a public breakthrough, every update
            reveals how God is moving across the land through obedience, faith, and
            love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stay connected, stay encouraged. The mission is alive—and this is the
            beginning of the end.

            Across cities and quiet corners, God is gathering His people. Through
            small moments of faith, unexpected meetings, and simple acts of love, a
            deeper work is unfolding. These aren’t movements for the spotlight—they
            are for those with ears to hear and hearts prepared. Each testimony
            shared, each Bible given, each question answered is part of the greater
            preparation—both for protection in the days ahead and for the salvation
            that draws near. We move not with fanfare but with focus—walking in
            obedience, led by the Spirit, watching as the harvest begins to ripen.

            Our mission goes beyond words—we live it out across the streets of South
            Dallas. We prepare sack lunches and distribute essential
            supplies—including Bibles and water—directly to the homeless community,
            meeting both physical and spiritual needs with compassion and care. We
            even read the Word aloud to those without the sight to do so themselves
            and answer any questions they may have about Scripture. Every interaction
            is an opportunity to share the living Word of God, offering hope, healing,
            and the promise of eternal life. These efforts reflect Christ’s love in
            action, made possible by your continued support. Together, we’re reaching
            the lost, uplifting the broken, and protecting God’s people one soul at a
            time.

            On weekend nights in Deep Ellum, we take to the streets with a heart full
            of purpose, handing out free Bibles and water while sharing the Good News
            of Christ. As people pass by, we offer more than just physical
            refreshment—we offer the living Word of God that brings eternal life. Each
            interaction is a divine opportunity to spread His love and light to those
            who may be searching or lost. Your donations make it possible for us to
            continue reaching out in this vibrant community, offering hope and
            salvation to all who will listen.

            Your generous support helps us gather essential supplies for our free
            Bible stands—water, Bibles, food, and other outreach materials—so we can
            go out into the streets and boldly share the message of salvation. Every
            Bible given and every conversation sparked is a seed planted for the
            Kingdom. Your support equips us to be living witnesses of the Gospel,
            reaching hearts that may never step inside a church. Thank you for
            standing with The Messianic Mission as we fulfill the Great Commission.

            This winter, Brady journeyed east with a purpose given from above: to
            initiate peace, protect God's people, and mark a time appointed in
            Heaven. Though Brady stood at the threshold, the way was withheld—not by
            man, but by divine restraint. What was meant to begin has quietly begun:
            a countdown long prophesied, now set in motion. There was no
            announcement, no acclaim—only a silent refusal that echoes Scripture
            itself. The world is not yet ready for full revelation, but those with
            ears to hear will understand the timing. The mission continues, steady
            and unseen, until the moment all things are made clear.

            Brady arrived in Istanbul just in time for the Universal Peace Federation
            meeting, where he shared our plans for the Holy Land. The event was
            uplifting, featuring inspiring speeches and offering wonderful
            opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals. Istanbul itself
            was a vibrant city, where we saw Christians dispersed throughout,
            alongside pockets of various faiths, creating a rich tapestry of diverse
            beliefs. We are looking forward to attending the UPF Summit in Berlin
            this May.

            In 2016, Brady met with a member of the U.S. intelligence community and,
            through the voice of God, foretold major global events—including the
            following three U.S. elections, the COVID-19 pandemic, the January 6
            Capitol riot, and the 2022 Ukraine war. In 2024, he accurately warned
            The Messianic Mission’s secretary of an assassination attempt on
            President Trump one week before it occurred. Upon turning 30, Brady
            abandoned his life, quit his job, sold his possessions, fasted for seven
            days, and flew to Israel in obedience to God’s call. There, he entered
            into a renewed covenant with God, and upon returning, founded The
            Messianic Mission to fulfill that eternal promise: to protect God’s
            people for the next 3.5 years and beyond.
