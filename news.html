            <h2>Community Outreach: Taking Christ to the Streets</h2>
            <p>Ongoing</p>
            <img src="/images/site/scripture-path-to-glowing-cross-in-sky.jpg" alt="Path made of scripture leading toward a glowing cross in the sky, breaking through clouds with light and divine promise." class="img-right">
            <p>Our mission goes beyond words—we live it out across the streets of South Dallas. We prepare sack lunches and distribute essential supplies—including Bibles and water—directly to the homeless community, meeting both physical and spiritual needs with compassion and care. We even read the Word aloud to those without the sight to do so themselves and answer any questions they may have about Scripture. Every interaction is an opportunity to share the living Word of God, offering hope, healing, and the promise of eternal life. These efforts reflect Christ’s love in action, made possible by your continued support. Together, we’re reaching the lost, uplifting the broken, and protecting God’s people one soul at a time.</p >
            <p>"If you give food to the hungry and satisfy those who are in need, then the darkness around you will turn to the brightness of noon."</p>
            <p>— Isaiah 58:10 (GNT)</p>

            <h2>Bible and Water Stands</h2>
            <p>Ongoing</p>
            <img src="/images/site/bright-street-lamp-in-darkness-symbolizing-guidance.jpeg" alt="Bright street lamp shining in complete darkness, symbolizing guidance and light in spiritual darkness." class="img-right">
            <p>On weekend nights in Deep Ellum, we take to the streets with a heart full of purpose, handing out free Bibles and water while sharing the Good News of Christ. As people pass by, we offer more than just physical refreshment—we offer the living Word of God that brings eternal life. Each interaction is a divine opportunity to spread His love and light to those who may be searching or lost. Your donations make it possible for us to continue reaching out in this vibrant community, offering hope and salvation to all who will listen.</p >
            <p>"'You are like light for the whole world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl; instead it is put on the lampstand, where it gives light for everyone in the house. In the same way your light must shine before people, so that they will see the good things you do and praise your Father in heaven."</p>
            <p>— Matthew 5:14-16 (GNT)</p>

            <p>Your generous donations help us gather essential supplies for our free Bible stands—water, Bibles, food, and other outreach materials—so we can go out into the streets and boldly share the message of salvation. Every Bible given and every conversation sparked is a seed planted for the Kingdom. Your support equips us to be living witnesses of the Gospel, reaching hearts that may never step inside a church. Thank you for standing with The Messianic Mission as we fulfill the Great Commission.</p>
            <p>"How wonderful is the coming of messengers who bring good news!"</p>

            <h2>Universal Peace Federation Meeting in Istanbul</h2>
	    <p>January 2025</p>
            <img src="/images/site/upf-istanbul-christ-unity-peace-meeting-photo.jpg" alt="United Peace Federation meeting in Istanbul promoting unity and peace, with leaders and members by flags and banners." class="img-right">
            <p>We arrived in Istanbul just in time for the Universal Peace Federation meeting, where we shared our plans for the Middle East. The event was uplifting, featuring inspiring speeches and offering wonderful opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals. Istanbul itself was a vibrant city, where we saw Christians dispersed throughout, alongside pockets of various faiths, creating a rich tapestry of diverse beliefs. We are looking forward to attending the UPF Summit in Berlin this May.</p>
            <p>"I pray that they may all be one. Father! May they be one in us, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they be one, so that the world will believe that you sent me."</p>
            <p>— John 17:21 (GNT)</p>
            <p>Prepare. Unite. Await His Return.</p>
