            <h2>Community Outreach: Taking Christ to the Streets</h2>
            <p>Ongoing</p>
            <img src="/images/Path.png" alt="Path" class="img-right">
            <p>Our mission goes beyond words—we live it out across the streets of South Dallas. We prepare sack lunches and distribute essential supplies—including Bibles and water—directly to the homeless community, meeting both physical and spiritual needs with compassion and care. We even read the Word aloud to those without the sight to do so themselves and answer any questions they may have about Scripture. Every interaction is an opportunity to share the living Word of God, offering hope, healing, and the promise of eternal life. These efforts reflect Christ’s love in action, made possible by your continued support. Together, we’re reaching the lost, uplifting the broken, and protecting God’s people one soul at a time.</p >
            <p>"If you give food to the hungry and satisfy those who are in need, then the darkness around you will turn to the brightness of noon."</p>

            <h2>Bible and Water Stands</h2>
            <p>Ongoing</p>
            <img src="/images/Light.jpeg" alt="Light" class="img-right">
            <p>On weekend nights in Deep Ellum, we take to the streets with a heart full of purpose, handing out free Bibles and water while sharing the Good News of Christ. As people pass by, we offer more than just physical refreshment—we offer the living Word of God that brings eternal life. Each interaction is a divine opportunity to spread His love and light to those who may be searching or lost. Your donations make it possible for us to continue reaching out in this vibrant community, offering hope and salvation to all who will listen.</p >
            <p>"The Lord says to his servants, 'You are the light of the world. Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.'"</p>

            <h2>Supplies Gathered</h2>
	    <p>February 2025</p>
            <img src="/images/Supplies.jpg" alt="Bible Purchasing" class="img-right">
            <p>Your generous donations help us gather essential supplies for our free Bible stands—water, Bibles, food, and other outreach materials—so we can go out into the streets and boldly share the message of salvation. Every Bible given and every conversation sparked is a seed planted for the Kingdom. Your support equips us to be living witnesses of the Gospel, reaching hearts that may never step inside a church. Thank you for standing with The Messianic Mission as we fulfill the Great Commission.</p>
            <p>"How wonderful is the coming of messengers who bring good news!"</p>

            <h2>Universal Peace Federation Meeting in Istanbul</h2>
	    <p>January 2025</p>
            <img src="/images/UPF.jpg" alt="UPF Meeting in Istanbul" class="img-right">
            <p>We arrived in Istanbul just in time for the Universal Peace Federation meeting, where we shared our plans for the Middle East. The event was uplifting, featuring inspiring speeches and offering wonderful opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals. Istanbul itself was a vibrant city, where we saw Christians dispersed throughout, alongside pockets of various faiths, creating a rich tapestry of diverse beliefs. We are looking forward to attending the UPF Summit in Berlin this May.</p>
            <p>"I pray that they may all be one. Father, may they be one in us, just as you are in me and I am in you. I pray that they may be one so that the world will believe that you sent me."</p>
            <p>— John 17:21 (GNT)</p>
            <p>Prepare. Unite. Await His Return.</p>
